# 🌡️ Numerical Simulation of Transient Heat Flow in a One-Dimensional Conductor
### with Temperature-Dependent Conductivity

> A computational study using the **Finite Difference Method (FDM)** to simulate how heat travels through a 1D rod over time — where the material's ability to conduct heat changes with temperature.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project models the **transient heat equation** in a one-dimensional conductor, with the added complexity of **temperature-dependent thermal conductivity** — meaning the material doesn't conduct heat the same way at all temperatures, which is closer to real-world behavior.

The simulation is implemented in **Python** and cross-validated against **MATLAB**, with results compared to analytical solutions and statistically evaluated using industry-standard error metrics.

This work was developed as part of a **Mathematical Modeling Internship** at **Sacred Heart College, Chalakkudy**.

## 🧠 What Problem Are We Solving?

Imagine a metal rod. One end is hot, the other is cold. Heat flows from hot to cold — but *how fast*, and *how does the temperature change at each point of the rod over time*?

That's the **heat equation**. Now add one more twist: the rod conducts heat *differently* depending on how hot it already is. That's **temperature-dependent conductivity**, and it makes the problem non-linear — which means we can't just solve it by hand easily.

That's where **numerical simulation** comes in.

## 📚 Mathematical Background

The governing equation is:

```
ρ·Cp · ∂T/∂t = ∂/∂x [ k(T) · ∂T/∂x ]
```

Where:
- `T` — Temperature (K or °C)
- `t` — Time (s)
- `x` — Position along the rod (m)
- `k(T)` — Thermal conductivity (temperature-dependent) (W/m·K)
- `ρ` — Density (kg/m³)
- `Cp` — Specific heat capacity (J/kg·K)

The FDM discretizes this equation over a grid in both space and time, turning it into a system of algebraic equations that can be solved step by step.
